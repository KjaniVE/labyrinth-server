# Labyrinth Server

Welcome to the **Labyrinth Server** repository! This project is a remake of a school project from last year. It's being revisited and redeveloped as a personal challenge to improve upon the original implementation and assess the progress I've made since then.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Learn and Improve**: Compare the new implementation with the original to measure improvement in code quality, efficiency, and maintainability.
- **Experimentation**: Test new design patterns, frameworks, or tools that I’ve learned over the past year.
- **Sharpen Skills**: Focus on enhancing backend development, API creation, and server management skills.

## 🛠️ Features

This section will be updated as the project develops, but here are some planned features:

- **Efficient Backend Logic**: Refactoring to improve code readability and performance.
- **Enhanced API**: Better endpoints, more robust error handling, and API documentation.
- **Testing Suite**: Add unit and integration tests for better reliability.
